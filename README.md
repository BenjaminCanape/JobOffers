# JobOffers
An app that will allow to apply to job offers 
<br/>
/**************** DESCRIPTION ****************/<br/><br/>
I intend to create an app where:
- Recruiters will be able to create job offers
- Candidates can apply to these offers by submiting a form where they upload their resume
- Both can follow every step of the appliance

I will use React.js / Express and MongoDB

/**************** INSTALLATION ****************/<br/><br/>
To launch the app you need to open 3 tabs in terminal:

The first one where you launch mongodb whith the command:
- mongod

Then in another tab, type these commands:
- cd server/
- npm install
- node app.js

Finaly, in the last tab:
- cd client/
- npm install
- npm start

Now you can go to http://localhost:3000/ and test the app
