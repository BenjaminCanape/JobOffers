# JobOffers

An app that will allow to apply to job offers

I intend to create an app where:

*   Recruiters will be able to create job offers
*   Candidates can apply to these offers by submiting a form where they upload their resume
*   Both can follow every step of the appliance

I will use React.js / Express and MongoDB

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need Node.js,npm and mongodb to install and run the app

### Installing

To launch the app you need to open 3 tabs in terminal:

The first one where you launch mongodb whith the command:

```
mongod
```

Then in another tab, type these commands:

```
cd server/
npm install
node app.js
```

Finaly, in the last tab:

```
cd client/
npm install
npm start
```

Now you can go to http://localhost:3000/ and test the app
