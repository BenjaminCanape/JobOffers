# JobOffers

An app that will allow to apply to job offers

I intend to create an app where:

*   Recruiters will be able to create job offers
*   Candidates can apply to these offers by submiting a form where they upload their resume
*   Both can follow every step of the appliance

I will use React.js, Express and MongoDB.

I also wanted to play with docker.

## Demo

You can use this demo here: https://joboffers-benjamincanape.herokuapp.com/

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need docker

### Installing

To launch the app you need to start your docker daemon and then type this command in the terminal:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Then you can test the app:

On linux : http://localhost:3000/

Others: whatever ip the docker daemon started on and port 3000
